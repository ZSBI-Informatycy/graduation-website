# SINISTER
*a graduation project by Claymore*

Sinister is an example company that I made up for the purpose of creating this website and presentation for a graduation project.

# Overview:

The project required the following:
 - HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge,
 - Basic Javascript,
 - at least 3 subpages,
 - a drawing of the website's layout and map

# Installation

Clone the repository and setup a local server in the root of the folder(where `index.html` resides) using python with the command: `python -m http.server`.
Then you can use your web browser to display the page at `https://localhost:8000`.
